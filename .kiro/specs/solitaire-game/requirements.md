# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a classic Klondike Solitaire game using Rust with the GPUI framework and gpui-component crates. The game will provide a complete desktop solitaire experience with drag-and-drop card interactions, game state management, and a clean user interface that follows modern design principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a properly laid out solitaire game board, so that I can immediately understand the game state and available moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display seven tableau columns with cards dealt according to Klondike rules (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 cards respectively)
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL show only the top card of each tableau pile face-up
3. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display four empty foundation piles (one for each suit)
4. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a stock pile with remaining cards face-down
5. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display an empty waste pile next to the stock

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with cards using drag and drop, so that I can make moves intuitively and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag a face-up card THEN the system SHALL allow me to move it if the move is valid
2. WHEN I drag a card over a valid drop target THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the move is allowed
3. WHEN I drag a card over an invalid drop target THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the move is not allowed
4. WHEN I release a card over a valid target THEN the system SHALL complete the move and update the game state
5. WHEN I release a card over an invalid target THEN the system SHALL return the card to its original position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to enforce solitaire rules automatically, so that I can focus on strategy without worrying about invalid moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to place a card on a tableau pile THEN the system SHALL only allow the move if the card is one rank lower and opposite color
2. WHEN I attempt to place a card on a foundation pile THEN the system SHALL only allow the move if it's the next card in ascending suit sequence
3. WHEN I click on a face-down card in a tableau pile THEN the system SHALL flip it face-up if it's the top card
4. WHEN I move a card from a tableau pile THEN the system SHALL automatically flip the newly exposed card face-up
5. WHEN I click the stock pile THEN the system SHALL deal cards to the waste pile according to the selected deal count (1 or 3)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to track my game progress and statistics, so that I can see my performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a game successfully THEN the system SHALL record a win in my statistics
2. WHEN I start a new game THEN the system SHALL increment the games played counter
3. WHEN I view game statistics THEN the system SHALL display total games played, games won, and win percentage
4. WHEN I'm playing THEN the system SHALL display the current move count
5. WHEN I'm playing THEN the system SHALL display elapsed time for the current game

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want game control options, so that I can manage my gameplay experience effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to start over THEN the system SHALL provide a "New Game" option that resets the board
2. WHEN I make a mistake THEN the system SHALL provide an "Undo" option for the last move
3. WHEN I want to change settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to toggle between 1-card and 3-card draw from stock
4. WHEN I want to quit THEN the system SHALL save my current statistics before closing
5. WHEN the game detects no more moves are possible THEN the system SHALL offer to start a new game

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback and animations, so that the game feels responsive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cards are moved THEN the system SHALL animate the movement smoothly
2. WHEN cards are flipped THEN the system SHALL show a flip animation
3. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual hover states
4. WHEN I complete the game THEN the system SHALL display a celebration animation or message
5. WHEN cards are dealt from stock THEN the system SHALL animate the dealing process

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have an attractive and intuitive interface, so that I enjoy playing and can easily understand all game elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the game THEN the system SHALL display cards with clear, readable suit symbols and numbers
2. WHEN I view the game THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors for red and black suits
3. WHEN I view the game THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient spacing between game elements for easy interaction
4. WHEN I resize the window THEN the system SHALL maintain proper proportions and usability
5. WHEN I view empty piles THEN the system SHALL show clear outlines or placeholders indicating where cards can be placed
